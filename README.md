A deep CNN for cell classification.
DeepCNN.py is the code, and it should be run on GPU or it will be very, very, very slow.
And Result-Record.txt records the experimental result of the code.
The dataset I used was published in 2014, and you can get them here: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mu9Mcl4laoHjHBWkdrvENg
The Report.pdf describes the whole process detailly.
